# 3.6 Barrier

Puzzle: Generalize the rendezvous solution. Every thread should run the
following code:

```
rendezvous
critical point
```

The synchronization requirement is that no thread executes critical point
until after all threads have executed rendezvous.

You can assume that there are n threads and that this value is stored in a
variable, n, that is accessible from all threads.
When the first n âˆ’ 1 threads arrive they should block until the nth thread
arrives, at which point all the threads may proceed.
